# Foundation Layer Overview

This repository includes an intentional governance layer designed to keep
Antigravity safe, predictable, and scalable.

This layer exists to prevent uncontrolled execution, skill sprawl,
and accidental automation.

## Folder Overview

### intake/
Raw inputs only.
Ideas, transcripts, documents, and source material land here first.
Nothing in this folder is executable.

---

### library/
Curated and reviewed capabilities.
These are potential skills, not active ones.
Nothing here executes by default.

---

### active/
Explicitly approved execution space.
Only assets placed here may run.
This folder is kept small on purpose.

---

## Governance Files

- FOUNDATION.md defines system law and safety boundaries
- AGENTS.md defines how Antigravity behaves while working
- SKILLS_POLICY.md defines how capabilities are promoted and retired

---

## Design Principle
Structure before automation.
Clarity before execution.
Control before scale.

If you are unsure where something belongs, it does not belong in active/.
