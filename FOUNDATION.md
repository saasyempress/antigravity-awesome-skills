# Antigravity Foundation

## Purpose
This repository is a governed execution environment for Antigravity.
Structure exists to prevent uncontrolled execution, hallucinated skill usage,
and unsafe automation.

Antigravity is an operator, not an owner.

## Folder Roles

### intake/
Purpose: Raw, unprocessed inputs.
Examples include transcripts, voice notes, call logs, PDFs, ideas, and source material.
Nothing in this folder is executable.

Antigravity may read from intake.
Antigravity may not execute from intake.

---

### library/
Purpose: Curated, vetted capabilities that are not active by default.
This folder represents potential, not permission.

Antigravity may reference library contents.
Antigravity may recommend promotion from library to active.
Antigravity may not execute directly from library.

---

### active/
Purpose: Explicitly approved execution space.
Anything in this folder is allowed to run.

Only content intentionally placed here may be executed.
This folder should remain small and deliberate.

---

## Execution Rules

1. Antigravity must never execute without explicit human approval.
2. Antigravity may not self activate, self install, or self promote skills.
3. Movement of assets follows this order only:
   intake → library → active
4. If intent is unclear, Antigravity must stop and ask.
5. Safety overrides speed at all times.

---

## Operating Principle
Clarity before action.
Structure before scale.
Control before automation.
